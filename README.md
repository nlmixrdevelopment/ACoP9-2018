**nlmixr short course @ ACoP9 2018**

The **nlmixr team** hosted a **half-day hands-on workshop** at ACoP9 2018 on simulation (RxODE) and parameter estimation using the **free and open-source R-based nonlinear mixed effects modelling platform nlmixr**. 
The course consisted of a mixture of lectures and hands-on exercises. Please find the agenda and a link to the course material below. 
**Thank you to all participants from around the world who joined us for this exciting event!**
